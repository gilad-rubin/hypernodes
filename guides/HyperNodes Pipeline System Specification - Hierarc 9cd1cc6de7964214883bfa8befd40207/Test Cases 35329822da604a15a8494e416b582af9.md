# Test Cases

# Overview

This document defines incremental test cases to verify the pipeline system design. Tests build progressively from simple single-node execution to complex nested pipelines with remote execution.

**Testing Philosophy:**

- Start simple, add complexity incrementally
- Each test validates one new concept
- Tests are ordered by dependency—later tests assume earlier ones pass
- Focus on core functionality before edge cases

# Test Phases

Each phase is documented in a separate page for better organization:

[Phase 1: Core Execution Tests](Test%20Cases%2035329822da604a15a8494e416b582af9/Phase%201%20Core%20Execution%20Tests%202a0863507a8145119517dc5f5a1ee87f.md)

[Phase 2: Map Operations Tests](Test%20Cases%2035329822da604a15a8494e416b582af9/Phase%202%20Map%20Operations%20Tests%20daf2cd1de7c7431f9249e49b5fbd67a2.md)

# Test Execution Strategy

**Recommended order:**

1. Run Phase 1 tests first (Core Execution)
2. Ensure all pass before moving to Phase 2
3. Progress through phases sequentially
4. Phase 8-9 tests require specific infrastructure

**For LLM Code Generation:**

Provide tests one phase at a time, ensuring each phase passes before implementing the next. This incremental approach helps catch design issues early and provides clear feedback on implementation quality.
