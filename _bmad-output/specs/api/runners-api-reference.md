## BaseRunner (Abstract)

All runners inherit from `BaseRunner`:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class BaseRunner(ABC):
    """Abstract base for all runners."""

    @property
    @abstractmethod
    def capabilities(self) -> RunnerCapabilities:
        """Declare what this runner supports."""
        ...

    @abstractmethod
    def run(self, graph: Graph, inputs: dict[str, Any], **kwargs):
        """Execute graph. Return type varies by runner."""
        ...

    @abstractmethod
    def map(
        self,
        graph: Graph,
        inputs: dict[str, Any],
        *,
        map_over: str | list[str],
        map_mode: Literal["zip", "product"] = "zip",
        **kwargs,
    ):
        """Batch execution. Return type varies by runner."""
        ...
```

## RunnerCapabilities

```python
@dataclass
class RunnerCapabilities:
    # Graph feature support
    supports_cycles: bool = True
    supports_gates: bool = True
    supports_interrupts: bool = False
    supports_async_nodes: bool = False
    supports_streaming: bool = False
    supports_distributed: bool = False

    # Execution interface
    returns_coroutine: bool = False  # Does .run() return a coroutine?

    def validate_graph(self, graph: Graph) -> None:
        """Raise IncompatibleRunnerError if graph uses unsupported features."""
        ...
```

- `parent_span_id: str | None` - Links to parent span (None for root nodes)
- `timestamp: float` - Unix timestamp

## Shared Validation

### validate_map_compatible()

Used internally by all runners before `.map()` operations:

    """
    Validate graph is compatible with map operations.

    Args:
        graph: Graph to validate.
        context: Description for error messages.

    Raises:

    Called from:
        - BaseRunner.map() at call time
        - Graph._validate() for GraphNodes with map_over at build time
    """
    if graph.has_interrupts:
        raise GraphConfigError(
            f"{context}, but the graph contains interrupts.\n\n"
            f"The problem: map runs the graph multiple times in batch,\n"
            f"but interrupts pause for human input - these don't mix.\n\n"
            f"How to fix:\n"
            f"  Use runner.run() in a loop instead of map:\n"
            f"    for item in items:\n"
            f"        result = runner.run(graph, inputs={{...item...}})\n"
            f"        if result.pause:\n"
            f"            # Handle interrupt\n"
        )
```

---

## Cross-Runner Execution (Nested Graphs)

Two things happen when a nested graph has a different runner:

### 1. Compatibility Validation

First, validate that the nested runner can handle the nested graph's features:

```python
def validate_runner_compatibility(graph: Graph, runner: BaseRunner) -> None:
    """
    Called at:
    - .as_node(runner=X) for explicit runners (build time)
    - runner.run() for inherited runners (runtime, recursive)
    """
    caps = runner.capabilities

    if graph.has_async_nodes and not caps.supports_async_nodes:
        raise IncompatibleRunnerError(
            f"Graph has async nodes, but {runner.__class__.__name__} "
            f"doesn't support async nodes."
        )

    if graph.has_cycles and not caps.supports_cycles:
        raise IncompatibleRunnerError(...)

    if graph.has_gates and not caps.supports_gates:
        raise IncompatibleRunnerError(...)

    if graph.has_interrupts and not caps.supports_interrupts:
        raise IncompatibleRunnerError(...)

    # Recurse into nested graphs
    for nested in graph.nested_graphs:
        nested_runner = nested.explicit_runner or runner  # Inherit if not explicit
        validate_runner_compatibility(nested.graph, nested_runner)
```

**Example:** DaftRunner with a nested graph containing interrupts → `IncompatibleRunnerError`

### 2. Execution Strategy

Then, determine *how* to call the nested runner based on `returns_coroutine`:

```python
def get_execution_strategy(parent: BaseRunner, nested: BaseRunner) -> ExecutionStrategy:
    parent_async = parent.capabilities.returns_coroutine
    nested_async = nested.capabilities.returns_coroutine

    match (parent_async, nested_async):
        case (True, True):   return ExecutionStrategy.AWAIT
        case (True, False):  return ExecutionStrategy.THREAD_POOL
        case (False, True):  return ExecutionStrategy.ASYNCIO_RUN
        case (False, False): return ExecutionStrategy.DIRECT
```

| Parent `returns_coroutine` | Nested `returns_coroutine` | Strategy |
|:--------------------------:|:--------------------------:|----------|
| ✅ | ✅ | Direct `await` |
| ✅ | ❌ | `asyncio.to_thread()` |
| ❌ | ✅ | `asyncio.run()` |
| ❌ | ❌ | Direct call |

### Runner Resolution Order

1. Explicit `runner=` on `.as_node()` (override)
2. Parent runner (inheritance)
3. `SyncRunner` (default fallback)
