title: Dask Engine
description: 'Parallel execution with Dask.'
---

The **DaskEngine** uses [Dask](https://www.dask.org/) to parallelize map operations across multiple cores or a distributed cluster.

## Why DaskEngine?

1.  **Parallelism**: Distributes `.map()` operations across available CPUs.
2.  **Smart Partitioning**: Automatically calculates optimal partitions based on workload type (CPU vs IO) and dataset size.
3.  **Zero Overhead**: Falls back to standard sequential execution for non-map operations, avoiding scheduler overhead for simple tasks.

## Configuration

```python
from hypernodes.engines import DaskEngine

engine = DaskEngine(
    scheduler="threads",      # "threads", "processes", or "synchronous"
    num_workers=None,         # Defaults to CPU count
    workload_type="mixed"     # "cpu", "io", or "mixed"
)
```

### Schedulers

- **threads** (Default): Best for I/O bound or mixed workloads. Low overhead.
- **processes**: Best for CPU bound workloads (bypasses GIL). Higher overhead.
- **synchronous**: Useful for debugging.

### Workload Optimization

The engine uses the `workload_type` hint to tune partitioning:

- **io**: 4x oversubscription. Assumes tasks wait on network/disk.
- **cpu**: 2x oversubscription. Matches core count closely.
- **mixed**: 3x oversubscription. Balanced approach.

## Usage

```python
pipeline = Pipeline(nodes=[...], engine=engine)

# This runs in parallel!
results = pipeline.map(
    inputs={"x": range(100)},
    map_over="x"
)
```
