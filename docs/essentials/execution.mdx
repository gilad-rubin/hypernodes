title: Execution
description: 'Running your pipelines.'

Once you have a `Pipeline`, you execute it using the `run()` method.

## Basic Execution

The `run()` method executes the pipeline once for a single set of inputs.

```python
results = pipeline.run(inputs={"x": 10, "y": 20})
```

- `inputs`: A dictionary mapping parameter names (root args) to values.
- Returns: A dictionary containing all node outputs.

## Selective Output

By default, `run()` returns the outputs of *all* nodes. You can request specific outputs to save memory or computation (though intermediate nodes will still run if needed).

```python
# Only get the final result
result = pipeline.run(
    inputs={"x": 10}, 
    output_name="final_step"
)
```

## Validation at Runtime

Before execution starts, `run()` validates:
1. That all required pipeline inputs are provided in the `inputs` dictionary.
2. That the requested `output_name` (if any) actually exists in the graph.

## The Execution Flow

1. **Signature Computation**: For each node, compute a hash based on code, inputs, and upstream dependencies.
2. **Cache Check**: Check if this signature exists in the configured cache.
3. **Execution (if miss)**: Run the function.
4. **Store (if miss)**: Save result to cache.
5. **Return**: Pass result to downstream nodes.

This ensures that if you run the pipeline twice with the same inputs, the second run is effectively instantaneous (if cached).
