HyperNodes is a hierarchical, modular pipeline system with intelligent caching designed for ML/AI development workflows. It treats caching as a first-class citizen, enabling developers to iterate rapidly without re-running expensive computations.

## Key Features

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Test with One, Scale to Many" icon="flask">
    Build and test your pipeline with a single input, then run it over thousands of inputs without changing a line of code.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Development-First Caching" icon="floppy-disk">
    HyperNodes automatically caches at node and example granularity. Only re-run what changed.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Hierarchical Modularity" icon="layer-group">
    Functions are nodes. Pipelines are nodes. Build complex workflows from simple, reusable pieces.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Flexible Execution" icon="bolt">
    Run sequentially for debugging, async for I/O, or distributed with [Daft](https://www.getdaft.io/).
  </Card>
  <Card title="First-Class Daft Support" icon="rocket">
    Deep integration with Daft for distributed, lazy, and batched execution.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Observable by Default" icon="chart-simple">
    Built-in progress bars, logs, and metrics. Every execution is tracked.
