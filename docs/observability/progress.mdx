description: 'Live execution monitoring.'

The `ProgressCallback` provides rich, real-time feedback on your pipeline's execution using `tqdm`.

![Progress Bar](/docs/assets/progress_bar.svg)

## Usage

Add the callback to your engine.

```python
from hypernodes import SeqEngine
from hypernodes.telemetry import ProgressCallback

engine = SeqEngine(
    callbacks=[ProgressCallback()]
)

pipeline.run(...)
```

## Features

- **Hierarchical Bars**: Shows nested pipeline progress.
- **Map Operations**: Shows overall map progress and individual node stats.
- **Cache Status**: Visually distinguishes cached nodes (⚡) from computed nodes (✓).
- **Timing**: Shows execution duration and rate (items/s).

## Environment Variables

You can control behavior via environment variables:

- `HN_PROGRESS_DEBUG=1`: Enable debug logging for the progress callback.

## Jupyter Support

The callback automatically detects if it's running in a Jupyter notebook and uses `tqdm.notebook` for HTML-based progress bars.
