Understanding complex DAGs can be difficult. HyperNodes provides built-in visualization tools to help you see the structure of your pipeline.

## `.visualize()`

You can generate a Graphviz diagram of any pipeline using the `.visualize()` method.

```python
pipeline.visualize()
```

- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Renders the SVG directly in the cell.
- **Scripts**: Returns a `graphviz.Digraph` object.

### Saving to File

```python
pipeline.visualize(filename="my_pipeline.svg")
```

## Controlling Detail

### Orientation

Change the layout direction with `orient`:

```python
pipeline.visualize(orient="LR")  # Left-to-Right (default is Top-Bottom)
```

### Nesting Depth

By default, HyperNodes collapses nested pipelines to keep the graph readable. You can control this with `depth`.

- `depth=1`: Show top-level nodes and collapsed sub-pipelines.
- `depth=None`: Fully expand all nested pipelines.

```python
pipeline.visualize(depth=None)
```

### Styling

HyperNodes comes with visual styles.

```python
pipeline.visualize(style="modern")
```

## Legend

For complex graphs, you can enable a legend to explain the different node shapes and colors (e.g., Pipeline Inputs vs Computed Nodes).

```python
pipeline.visualize(show_legend=True)
```
